# Garden Linux

A Linux backend for [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden).

You can deploy Garden-Linux using the [Garden-Linux BOSH Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release).
This is the only "supported" way to use Garden-Linux.
If you're not using BOSH, and still want to have a play, follow the insructions below.

## Installing Garden-Linux

**Note:** the rest of these instructions assume you arranged for the garden-linux code and dependencies to be
present in your `$GOPATH` on a machine running Ubuntu 14.04 or later with Go 1.6 installed.
The easiest way to achieve this is actually to check out the [Garden-Linux BOSH Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release), since that's the only place that all the dependency version data is recorded.
The steps are:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release
cd garden-linux-release
export GOPATH=$PWD
```

### Install and load aufs

```
sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)
sudo modprobe aufs
```

### Build garden-linux

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux # assuming your $GOPATH has only one entry
make
```

### Set up necessary directories

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/garden/depot /opt/garden/graph /opt/garden/state
```

### Download a RootFS (Optional)

If you plan to run docker images instead of using rootfs from disk, you can skip this step.

e.g. if you want to use the default Cloud Foundry rootfs:
```
wget https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/download/1.19.0/cflinuxfs2-1.19.0.tar.gz
sudo mkdir /opt/garden/rootfs
sudo tar -xzpf cflinuxfs2-1.19.0.tar.gz -C /opt/garden/rootfs
```

### Run garden-linux

Note that if you opted not to download a rootfs in the previous step, you can remove the `-rootfs=/opt/garden/rootfs` parameter from the command.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux # assuming your $GOPATH has only one entry
sudo ./out/garden-linux \
       -depot=/opt/garden/depot \
       -graph=/opt/garden/graph \
       -stateDir=/opt/garden/state \
       -rootfs=/opt/garden/rootfs \
       -bin=$PWD/linux_backend/bin \
       -listenNetwork=tcp \
       -listenAddr=127.0.0.1:7777
```

### Kick the tyres

The easiest way to start creating containers is using the unofficial [`gaol`](https://github.com/contraband/gaol) command line client.
For more advanced use cases, you'll want to use the [Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) client package.

## Development

See the [Developer's Guide](docs/DEVELOPING.md) to get started.

Many integration tests are in another repository, [Garden Integration Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-integration-tests).
